First of all, we need add pinpoint to our project. 

### Initializing Amazon Pinpoint via Amplify

**On the command line, in the photoalbums directory**:

1. **Run** `amplify add analytics`

1. **Press _Enter_**

1. **Define a resource name** like _photoalbums_

1. **Let unauthenticated users send analytics events as well** (as we let unauthenticated users browse our albums and look at our images)

3. Wait for the provisioning to complete. This will take a few minutes.
