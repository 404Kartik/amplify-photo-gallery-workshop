Next we need to alter and add code in our **src/app.js** to generate trackable events from our application. 

Around line 10 we need to add **Analytics** to our import. The line should look like 

```javascript
import Amplify, { Analytics, API, Auth, graphqlOperation, Storage } from 'aws-amplify';
```

Then we need to add the event generation where we want to track our user interaction: 

```javascript
Analytics.record({ name: 'app-launch' });
```

The code should be placed within the render of the classes we want to track like below: 

```javascript
class AlbumsListLoader extends React.Component {
    onNewAlbum = (prevQuery, newData) => {
        // When we get data about a new album, we need to put in into an object 
        // with the same shape as the original query results, but with the new data added as well
        let updatedQuery = Object.assign({}, prevQuery);
        updatedQuery.listAlbums.items = prevQuery.listAlbums.items.concat([newData.onCreateAlbum]);
        return updatedQuery;
    }

    render() {
        Analytics.record({ name: 'app-launch' });
        return (
            <Connect 
                query={graphqlOperation(ListAlbums)}
                subscription={graphqlOperation(SubscribeToNewAlbums)} 
                onSubscriptionMsg={this.onNewAlbum}
            >
                {({ data, loading, errors }) => {
                    if (loading) { return <div>Loading...</div>; }
                    if (errors.length > 0) { return <div>{JSON.stringify(errors)}</div>; }
                    if (!data.listAlbums) return;

                return <AlbumsList albums={data.listAlbums.items} />;
                }}
            </Connect>
        );
    }
}
```
