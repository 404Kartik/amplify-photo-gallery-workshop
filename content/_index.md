    <strong>Attention</strong>
    <p style="text-align: left">
    This workshop content is over a year old and AWS Amplify has made a great deal of improvements 
    since this content was originally written. We're working on a fresh new version of this workshop to be released
    in early 2020 (we hope)!  
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left">
    In the mean time, instead of this workshop, please check out some of the more up-to-date Amplify content. One great 
    example is the <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-serverless-airline-booking">AWS Serverless Airline Booking</a> project. 
    Besides that, you can find lots more excellent AWS Amplify content on the <a href="https://amplify.aws/community/">AWS Amplify Community</a> site.

    If you would still like to review the content of this workshop, these instructions should still work, 
    provided you use the specific version of AWS Amplify noted in the Prerequisites section.

    In this workshop, we'll use React to build a data-driven web app that lets users upload photos to secure photo galleries. We'll use AWS AppSync to get up and running quickly with a GraphQL API that backs our data in Amazon DynamoDB. In addition, we'll demonstrate how to use the AWS Amplify library to authenticate users, communicate with our API, and manage photo uploads. Finally, we add in AI-powered object tagging using Amazon Rekognition, allowing users to discover photos without any manual data entry.
